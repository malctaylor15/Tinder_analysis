# Tinder_analysis
Explore My Tinder Data  

In this repository, I am beginning to examine Tinder available from my Tinder profile. We are able to recieve **our** side of the conversation for your past matches.  

We are able to conduct some light analysis on the conversations to understand how the app has been used over time.  

As of 12/12/2018, the plan is to create a short report so that other people can simply upload the json and learn something about their Tinder usage.
