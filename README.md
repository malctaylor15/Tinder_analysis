# Tinder_analysis
Explore My Tinder Data  

In this repository, I am beginning to examine Tinder available from my Tinder profile. We are able to recieve **our** side of the conversation for your past matches.  

We are able to conduct some light analysis on the conversations to understand how the app has been used over time.  

As of 12/12/2018, the plan is to create a short report so that other people can simply upload the json and learn something about their Tinder usage.  


## Download your Tinder Data  

Tinder allows users to download some of their data that is stored with on the servers. You can begin by going [here](https://account.gotinder.com/data). You will recieve an email that the file will be available for download within 3 days (mine came on the 3rd day) with only 24 hours to download before the link expires.  

After you download the zip file, there should be 3 items: an index.html, a folder called your_photos, and a file called data.json. The index_html reads the data.json and provides several tabs and makes some of the raw data more readable. It is worth poking through the index html to browse the data to ensure it is what you expect it to be.  

I intend for the app to use the data.json file. The json will have all the same content as the local webpage.
